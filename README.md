# DadJokes

Dad Joke Generator
This project is a simple web application that generates dad jokes with the click of a button. Leveraging the icanhazdadjoke API, it fetches random dad jokes and displays them on the webpage. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the fetch API for making asynchronous requests. It employs modern JavaScript features like async/await for cleaner and more readable code.

Features:
1. Fetches random dad jokes from the icanhazdadjoke API.
2. Updates the joke display dynamically without refreshing the page.
3. Simple and intuitive user interface with a single button to generate jokes.
4. Feel free to contribute, suggest improvements, or report issues! ðŸŽ‰
